# Feature: Auth

## TODOs
- [ ] fixing the form validation, when focusing on a field, setErrors(null)
- [x] don't hard code the endpoints, add api/endpoints.js
- [x] check if we can split the rendered page into multiple components
- [ ] add eye for password field


## Auth Flow

register -> verify user account -> resend verification code -> verify user account

initiate password reset = when forgetting password -> verify and reset password
